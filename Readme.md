# Qt QML Sample Projects üöÄ

This repository contains a collection of Qt QML sample projects that I created while learning Qt QML. Each project focuses on specific features or concepts, ranging from basic UI elements to animations, state machines, and integrations with C++.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Qt 6
- QML (Qt Modeling Language)
- Qt Quick Controls
- C++ 
- Qt Creator / CMake

## üì¶ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/qt-qml-samples.git
   cd qt-qml-samples

2. Open in QT creator, build and run.

## üìö Learnings Table

 | Concept | Learning Description | Example Usage / Notes
| Project Name    	| Concept	| Learning						| Example					|
| ----------------- | ---------	| ----------------------------- | -------------------------	|
| Login with Dashboard		| 	 setContextProperty or qmlRegisterType   	| - setContextProperty creates the object in the main.cpp file itself, hence object is initialized already and starts it's executions i.e., specified in it's constructor, on the other hand qmlRegisterType just registers the cpp class as a qml type and does not create the object, qml has the resposibility to initialize it.
- if it is a global object to be used in all qml files with maybe static values then we could use setContextProperty, as with qmlRegisterType object is initialized when used in qml and object gets destructed when the qml is unloaded, and then created again if the qml is loaded again|							|
